    "Why is it a problem that women are underrepresented in computing, math, and engineering? For whom is it a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that the underrepresentation of women in these fields also hurt men. One finding from India found that male leaders held less implicit bias when they had female leadership alongside them (Beaman et al., 2009). "

    "How is the representation and status of women in computing today different from the 1950s and 1960s? What are some of the forces that brought on this change?\n",
    "\n",
    "During World War 2, we actually saw a majority of women in the computing industry. This declined drastically after the war but in 1950s and 1960s the number of women in computing was similar to what it is today (around 26%). The percentaged reached a peak in the 1990s with around 35% of the computing workforce being women. Computing during the 1950s and 1960s was largely seen as an administrative extension and thereby women were encouraged to participate in large numbers. The decline after the 1990s is often attributed to the rise of personal computers which were seen as new toys for boys and the growing interest in the area. This early experience gave them an advantage as the computing market expanded. "

    "Which of the barriers and unequal challenges described in the section “Why So Few?” can be eroded by events that spotlight the achievement of women in STEM?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having spotlight on women in the industry is an important step to reducing stigma and feelings of isolation while also giving role models for women in computer science. A third of women in private-sector technical jobs feel extremeley isolated at work and four out of ten female engineers reported a lack of role models. The book mentions how seeing other women in leadership roles can actually help women from the harmful effect of stereotyping effect (Van Loo & Rydell, 2014). These effects have a cascade effect as increase in female representation leads to more representation which further reduces feelings of isolation and increases representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "These talks also begin the process of building social networks which has predominantly been dominated by men. The book highlights how research has identified that these male-dominated social networks exclude women (Faulkner, 2009a). Having women talk about their professional experiences and connect with students begins the process of opening up the network to women. "

    "# First Lightning Talk\n",
    "\n",
    "Amy Yuen's talk discussed whether the United Nation Security Council is truly a Democratic Institution. On the onset, the voting rules seems to inherently favor the powerful since certain members are given veto powers. Why do other countries then spend significant resources and money on running for seats on the Security Council even if they have significantly less power? The talk analysis two different ways to look at democratic institutions: Institutional Rules which contains the voting inside the council and serving on the council; and Representation which looks at which issues are discussed and what the participation level of the non-permanent members are. The overall findings were that while the security council institutional rules aren't very democratic, it is fairly representative and inclusive. From the talk, I learned about how one can use data for issues that are not necessarily data oriented. I wouldn't at first think to use data analysis to come to a conclusion about the level of democracy of an institution since it feels more vague than other issues but now I do think it can be very useful to back up ones claims."
